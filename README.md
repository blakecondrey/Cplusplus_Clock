# Cplusplus_Clock
C++ 12 hour/24 hour format

For this project, we were tasked with developing a C++, object oriented programming application to create two clocks that simultaneously display a 12 and 24 hour
clock, and allow for user input, which would allow the user to edit the time after initially displaying current time. Also, we were tasked with proper 
modularization of the code so that the "main.cpp" file hade the least amount of code as possible. This was our first instance of utilizing header files.
